# AgenticAI-HandsOn
Agentic AI Hands-On Lab for Summit Connect Darmstadt 2024

This Agentic AI Hands-On Lab offers a practical introduction to building autonomous AI agents using the Phidata framework and Ollama. Phidata simplifies the creation, deployment, and monitoring of AI agents by integrating memory, knowledge, and tools into large language models (LLMs). Ollama complements this by allowing everyone to run LLMs locally, ensuring data privacy and reducing latency. Together, they provide a robust environment for quickly developing and experimenting with Agentic AI applications using local models.

You'll learn the basic concepts and capabilties of using local models for agentic AI.
Agentic AI represents a significant advancement, combining the versatility of LLMs with the precision of traditional programming. This fusion allows AI systems to autonomously perform tasks, make decisions, and interact with external environments, thereby enhancing their utility across various applications. By participating in this hands-on experience, you will gain valuable insights into the practical aspects of Agentic AI, positioning yourself at the forefront of this transformative technology.
